This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
I have spent my career working in education and education grant's management. I have always been passionate about educational equity, particularly for marginalized groups of students.  I'm slightly nervous about being a student again at this point in my life, but I'm hopeful that what I learn in this program will complement what I do at work.
